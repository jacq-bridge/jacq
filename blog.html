            <h4>Letters from the battlefield</h4>
            <h5>08/09/2020</h5>
          </header>
          <p>Today I read ‘Letters from the battlefield’. It’s a short story by Brad Phillips
            in his book <i>Essays and Fictions</i>. ‘Letters from the battlefield’ confronts you with
            your mortality. It made me think about the fact that I might die not on my own terms.
            Worse than that, someone I love will die before I’m ready for it. I might miss the
            opportunity to say something nice to them, or to let them in on some truth. </p>

            <p>I’m helping someone write a cookbook for carers of the elderly, so I have to do
              all this research on people coming to the end of their lives and no longer wanting
              to eat. You’re supposed to lace their food with extra fat and sugar so they get the
              calories they need to stay alive. If you’re making someone pasta, put a knob of butter
              in the pot after draining. Your tastebuds weaken as you grow old. Add parsnips to carrot
              cake so they can taste the sweetness while getting essential nutrients. </p>

              <p>I could try writing letters from the battlefield. Letters for people to read
                after I’ve died. But there’s no way to be sure that the letters would survive.
                With the rate that technology progresses they’d be another thing lost to the internet.
                If I wrote them on paper they’re going to get lost in the world, or someone
                could find them and read them before I’m dead. </p>

                <p> When you age there are a lot of things that can cause you to lose interest
                  in food. Dementia is a big one. If you suffer from dementia you can forget how
                  to eat. Someone can shovel food into your mouth and you won’t know how to chew
                  or swallow it. The food will sit there, mush on your tongue. You might forget
                  to eat or forget you’ve eaten, or forget what you like to eat. Some people forget
                  they’re lifelong vegetarians. </p>

                  <p> Perhaps a letter would be some comfort to people if I get dementia. A reminder
                    of the person who used to be around, before they forgot. I’m twenty-five now though.
                    If this were to happen it’s going to be in fifty or so years. In the year 2070
                    I might have dementia, or I might be dead. Someone might be feeding me buttered
                    pasta and parsnip carrot cake, manipulating my jaw so my teeth chew it up.  </p>

                    <p> If I were to write a letter from the battlefield now I don’t know who
                    I’d write it to. It’s safe to assume my parents will have died by 2070.
                    As a twenty-five year old, I’m not confident the people I like and love
                    now will be the people I like and love in fifty years. I could pour hours
                    into this letter and the person it’s for will have forgotten my name by then. </p>

                    <p> Before now I used to worry about ageing in the context of reaching thirty
                      and feeling as though I had accomplished very little. But now I’ve found
                      many more years to worry about. </p>
