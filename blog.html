            <h4>Drowned Towns</h4>
            <h5>20/08/2020</h5>
          </header>
          <p>There are a number of drowned towns in the UK. ‘Drowned’ is the term given to towns that have been
            flooded to form a reservoir. Historically, there’s often controversy surrounding the drowning of a
            village. There’s a need for water in an area, and a well-placed valley to fill. But there’s a population
            of people who have built their lives there. They’re in the way. A lot of the town drownings in the UK
            happened so long ago that there aren’t many people still bitter. </p>

          <p>I’ve been interested in drowned towns since I used to sail on Rutland Water when I was a child. It’s
            a reservoir northwest of Peterborough, among the largest manmade lakes in Europe. To make Rutland Water
            the towns of Nether Hambleton and Middle Hambleton were first demolished, then flooded. I didn’t know
            they had been demolished when I sailed on top of them. I thought that deep under the water they were
            intact, dormant. I didn’t really even understand that the flooding of the town wasn’t some freak accident.
            I pictured water crashing through the village from an unknown source, people fleeing.  </p>

            <p>There was a rumour that the anchors of rescue boats would sometimes catch on a church spire under the
              water. In my head, I saw a dilapidated building with its tower thrust towards the surface. Church benches
              suspended inside. Segments taken out of it by anchors over the years. The reality is that there was only
              one church in Nether Hambleton and it still exists above the water.  </p>

            <p>I would spend hours sailing, daydreaming about the town below. Rooms with furniture floating inside.
              Fish swimming through the streets, in and out of windows. Street signs directing waterlogged cars.
              It scared me to fall into the water. I thought that should our boat capsize, the rigging may snag on
              a chimney. I imagined a drowned resident pulling me down, antagonised by our enjoyment of the water
              above them.</p>
