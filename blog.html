            <h4>The McFlurry: A History</h4>
            <h5>31/07/2020</h5>
          </header>
          <p> The McFlurry was first introduced in 1997. It was invented in 1995 by Ron McLellan,
            a McDonalds franchisee. A McFlurry consists of whipped soft serve vanilla ice cream and
            a sweet topping. The original flavours for a McFlurry were Oreo, Heath, Nestle Crunch,
            M&M’s and Butterfinger. I don’t know what a Heath is, or a Nestle Crunch. The original
            flavours of McFlurry served at McDonalds in West Quay Shopping Centre in Southampton were
            Smarties, Crunchie and Dairy Milk.  </p>

          <p>McFlurries are served and eaten with a hollow, square, plastic spoon. The spoon is clipped
              into a machine purpose built to stir the topping into the ice cream. The process of stirring
              the topping into the ice cream is called flurrying. It is an uncomfortable spoon to hold and
              eat from. In West Quay McDonalds they don’t use a machine to flurry the McFlurry. I’ve stood
              in front of the counter and watched, no machine and no flurrying of any kind. Just uncomfortable
              square spoons to mix with yourself. In Australia and New Zealand they took away the flying
              machines altogether, instead their McFlurries are ‘hand stirred – with love – by our crew.’
              They got rid of the square spoons in favour of regular looking spoons. </p>

            <p>In the US you can buy a McFlurry in regular or snack size. Regular size is 340g and has
                around 640 calories depending on your topping. A snack size is 226g and around 420 calories.
                At West Quay McDonalds between 2007 and 2013 you could buy just one size of McFlurry, it was
                170g and around 220 calories. Now in the UK a regular McFlurry is 150g. I used to eat a McFlurry
                at the same time as my fries. I would dip a fry into the McFlurry and savour the sweet, salt,
                hot, cold mix. By the end of my meal, the McFlurry would be warmed into a salty syrupy soup that
                I would pour into the bin. </p>

            <p>Between 1997 and 2006 if you wanted to trap a hedgehog you could use a McFlurry. You’d need to leave
              a near empty cup of Mcflurry, lid on, where the hedgehog had been sighted. Then the next morning you’d
              find a hedgehog with its head lodged firmly in the hole in the lid. Hundreds of hedgehogs were walking
              around, blinded by the pots of McFlurry stuck to their heads. If you type ‘hedgehog mcflurry’ into Google
              Images you can see them. Faces covered in ice cream, looking at you forlornly from their plastic traps.
              In 2006 McDonalds announced they’d be changing their design after a campaign by the British Hedgehog
              Preservation Society. No more trapped hedgehogs.</p>

            <p>The world record for fastest time to eat a McFlurry is 20.35 seconds. It was set by Josh Katz in November
              2014. You can watch a video of him setting the record here. The video has one comment, written two years
              after it was published, ‘Let’s see the inside of the cup.’ Josh eats the McFlurry in 8 scoops. He shows
              no sign of brain freeze. It’s a feat. I think I could eat a McFlurry in 60 seconds if I tried really hard.
              They discontinued the Crunchie McFlurry so I have no interest in eating McFlurries anymore, not even for a
              world record. Josh Katz doesn’t have any other world records on the recordsetter website. He ate a McFlurry
              in 2014 and has achieved nothing record worthy since.</p>

            <p>In some countries McFlurries have sauces - chocolate, strawberry, mint. At the McDonalds in West Quay between
               2007 and 2013 the McFlurries were served without sauce. The first McFlurry I had with sauce on was in Barcelona
               in 2008. I ordered an Oreo McFlurry and it came with chocolate sauce. The McFlurry was flurried and the sauce
               and ice cream were fully combined. It was too sweet and sticky, the sauce coated my tongue and teeth. I didn’t
               dip my fries because I didn’t want to ruin them with chocolate sauce. When I came back to West Quay McDonalds
               I savoured my non-sauced McFlurry. A McFlurry is not a sundae, it doesn't need sauce. </p>

            <p>If you go to mcdonalds.fandom.com you can read about the OgreLoad McFlurry. The OgreLoad McFlurry was a promotional
              McFlurry in 2007 for the release of the film ‘Shrek the Third’, it also made an appearance in 2011 for ‘Shrek Forever After’.
              It was a chocolate mint Aero McFlurry. The fandom page claims that ‘While Mike Meyers hates mint chocolate ice cream,
              he finally relented and endorsed the product after they offered to create a version without mint just for him.’
              If you type ‘does mike myers hate mint chocolate ice cream’ into Google there are no relevant results, and it
              suggests you might be looking for ‘does michael myers hate mint chocolate ice cream’. Upon clicking through
              Google’s suggested result there is no evidence that Michael Myers hated mint chocolate ice cream either.</p>

            <p>McFlurries are sold in 99 countries across the world. If I had to guess I would say I’ve eaten McFlurries in
              4 or 5 of these countries. The majority of McFlurries I have consumed have been at the food court in West Quay
              Southampton. I would buy a McFlurry after school and sit with friends to eat it. I would buy a meal at McDonalds
              after shopping on the weekend and eat my McFlurry alongside. After I found out both my GCSE and A Level results
              I went to the food court and bought a McFlurry. A date for my boyfriend and me would be to sit with a McFlurry
              and fries and chat. One time we were sitting and dipping and eating and I saw an elderly man sitting alone at
              the table behind us. I felt for some reason that this was an impossibly lonely sight. </p>
