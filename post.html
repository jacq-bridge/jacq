      <h3><date>20/07/2020</date></h3>
<p> This is my first blog post. I am doing my best Carrie from Sex and the City impression, sitting at my laptop in my prettiest white broderie anglaise dress. Occasionally I’ll look pensively out of my window pretending like I’m trying to make sense of the world while actually resisting the urge to unlock my phone and scroll Twitter. <br>
<br>
The reason I’m writing a blog is because I want to be a writer - an actual writer that people pay money to write words. It’s dawned on me today that no one is willing to pay me to write words if I have no words to show them so here we are. The decision to become a writer was a difficult one. For the past three years I’ve been working for Monzo. You know Monzo, it’s the hot coral card you’ve got in your wallet because it’s pretty and because you had your Barclays account since you were eleven and felt like actually knowing how much money you have. I started at Monzo in customer service after finishing a degree in comparative literature. Three years and five different job titles later I’ve been made redundant from my role in the People Team (known as HR outside of startups). I decided to volunteer for redundancy because helping people with HR questions really isn’t that fulfilling. I’m sure it is for some people, but finding, downloading, and sending someone their last 12 months of payslips on an antiquated payroll system is not my idea of fun. Especially not every day, forever. <br>
<br>
Instead I’m hopefully going to be writing things for a living. So I figured I start my first blog post with something I know a little about — baking. I’ve been really into baking since I was little. The idea that combining boring ingredients (eggs, flour, butter, sugar) and putting it in the oven could make a delicious cake was especially exciting to me as I grew up in a house where treats were banned. If we wanted something sweet for dessert we could have fruit. Baking meant that I could eat deliciously unhealthy foods with the approval of my mum. Baking sponge cakes opened up a whole new world. I could add extra ingredients to the cake mixture to change the flavour and texture. I could decorate with icing and sprinkles and different colours. My first big experiment was when I turned sixteen and made a seven layer rainbow cake to celebrate. I had no qualms about baking my own birthday cake - I loved it. The creativity that baking allowed me was wonderful, and seeing other people eating it, enjoying it and complimenting me on it felt validating. I could do something I enjoyed that other people could enjoy too. So now I’m twenty five and I’ve been baking more than just sponge cakes for a while. When I was working at Monzo I’d bring my baked goods to the office and watch as people wandered into the kitchen and emerged with a plate of my newest experiment. People began to know me as someone who can bake, Jacq the baker. This felt great and I revelled in it, but really my favourite baking experiments are those that go badly. <br> 
<br>
My most recent baking disaster was sourdough cinnamon buns. Like everybody else in lockdown I was enticed by the promise of a sourdough starter. No more spending £4-5 on a loaf of sourdough and supporting my local bakery, I’d be baking my own from now on. I was sent a small ziplock bag of beige sludge by the former CEO of Monzo, who had kindly offered to post sourdough starter to anyone who wanted some. I squeezed it into a tub, added flour and water, and put it in my fridge. There it sat, fed diligently every week for twelve week. By this point it was pungently sour. I had a cup of discard from my latest feed and decided I’d do something with it. So I googled ‘recipes for sourdough discard’ and came across this <a href="https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2017/12/how-to-make-sourdough-cinnamon-rolls-step-by-step-guide/" target="_blank"> cinnamon roll recipe </a>. It seemed just complicated enough to challenge me but having made cinnamon rolls before it had a bit of the familiar for comfort. Plus I love an overnight recipe, waking up in the morning with a purpose and the promise of something tasty for breakfast. The reviews were good, someone had already asked about making it without a stand mixer and been told it was fine, so I was confident. <br>
<br>
Things started off great. I made the dough easily, it was a little sticky but not unmanageably so. The first rise was fine, the dough increased in size more than expected as it was a hot day but this is no bad thing. I turned the dough out onto a floured and oiled surface and it stuck immediately. Somehow during the rise it had become stickier. Still, I attempted kneading and covered my hands in flour and which then stuck to the dough which stuck to my fingers. I ended up washing about a quarter of the dough off my hands and down the sink. We’d be eating fewer cinnamon buns but that’s fine - there’s only three of us in my flat so we can’t get through twelve buns anyway. I cleaned up and put the dough away for a second rise. After half an hour I poked it to see how airy it had become (not very) and folded it into itself a few times - a well documented sourdough technique. I covered it again and put it on the counter to rise overnight, foolishly excited for what I thought was going to be my breakfast the next day. <br>
<br>
I woke up late and got to work on it around 10am. What I’d failed to realise was that if you want to eat sourdough cinnamon buns for breakfast you have to get up early, like a baker. I figured midday cinnamon buns wouldn’t be so bad so I forged on. The first thing I noticed was that my dough smelled sour. Really really sour. I checked the recipe to see if this was expected but it made no mention of your dough smelling so sour your eyes water. I figured a go in the oven might somehow cook the sourness out (I’m not a professional baker) so I rolled out the dough and added cinnamon sugar and butter. The dough was still extremely sticky so rolling it up into lovely swirls was not an option. I tried my best though and loaded the lopsided buns into a greased cake tin. Another two hours of rising and they were finally ready for the oven. They baked in forty five minutes and in the meantime I made some cream cheese icing. I don’t like cream cheese. I don’t know why I thought adding icing sugar and butter to it would make me like it any more, but I was too far in to start questioning the choice I had made twelve hours earlier. I spread the icing on the cooled rolls and thought about the decisions that had led to this moment. It was 1pm and I was hungry and all I had to eat was these buns. <br>
<br>
There were so very many things wrong with these buns. The texture was hard and chewy with globs of soft icing that coats your tongue. The taste was a combination of extremely sour, sweet and creamy. The butter had melted and then hardened into a cinnamon-y caramel that stuck in your teeth. They didn’t look good and they didn’t taste good. I had spent twelve to thirteen hours making unappetising lumps of dough and icing. They sat, as all my failed experiments do, on the counter of our kitchen for two days until I needed to use one of the three normal sized plates we own and tipped them into the bin. My first foray into sourdough baking was a complete failure but an experience. I know now that baking sourdough cinnamon buns is hard, and much more effort than they’re worth. <br>
<br>
      I hope you’ve enjoyed this first blog post - I’ll endeavour to do more. For now though I’m going to satisfy my stupid brain and scroll some Twitter. <br>
