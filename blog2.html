          <h4>Calathea</h4>
          <h5>22/07/2020</h5>
        </header>
              <p>Looking around my room right now I count ten plants. Zig zag cactus, string of hearts, fittonia, snake plant,
                unnamed succulent, burro’s tail, parlour palm, unnamed cactus, Chinese money plant, and a kentia palm.
                If I were to go out into my living room I could count five more. A huge monstera deliciosa, fiddle leaf
                fig, another parlour palm, a jade plant and hedge cactus. Plants just make rooms better. They keep you
                in oxygen, and if they’re all alive they make you look like a semi-responsible adult. This is the problem
                with plants though, you have to look after them. </p>
              <p>In general I’d say I’m a pretty good plant parent. I water them about once a week, some more, some less.
                I check their soil to make sure it’s not soaked through or too dry. I’ll spritz the tropical looking ones
                every now and then with my cute purple spritzer. I’m responsible but not overbearing. This has worked well
                for me for the last three years, I’ve only lost one plant and that’s because I went out of town and my
                housemates forgot to water it. Not really my fault but a loss nonetheless. In April this year however,
                my plant luck ran out. It began when I noticed my calathea ornata was looking a little droopy. Calathea
                ornata is otherwise known as a pinstripe plant because it has these amazing stripes on the leaves. My
                calathea had dark green leaves with bright pink stripes, it was really pretty. Until it went and died. </p>
              <p>The lovely bright leaves began curling and browning at the ends. I felt the soil and decided more water
                would help. I kept a lazy eye on it, poking the soil and spritzing every now and then. After a week it
                hadn’t improved and if anything was getting worse. That’s when I decided to look closer to see if I could
                figure out the cause of my baby’s decline. I put my head really close to the plant and on the leaves and
                stems I could see these tiny white bugs. I pulled back and they were everywhere, crawling up and down its
                beautiful pinstripes.I really don’t like small bugs in large quantities.
                There’s something about how tiny tiny they are combined with how numerous that makes me itch — I’m squirming even
                thinking about it. Seeing these bugs on a plant in my bedroom nearly sent me over the edge. </p>
              <p>I googled ‘tiny white bugs on plants lots gross’ to find out what I was dealing with. It turned out that
                they were mealy bugs and advice was to clean leaves and stems with soapy water. I added some fairy liquid
                to my spritz bottle and wiped the plant clean. Then I went inside and scrubbed myself clean in the shower.
                I repeated this for a few days and moved my plant into quarantine all by itself. After a week the bugs were
                gone but I’d lost a couple of leaves in the process. No trouble as there were plenty of leaves to go around.
                I wanted to make sure I didn’t spread the mealybugs to other plants so I left my pretty little calathea in
                another room. I came back a week later and so did the mealybugs. There was no saving my poor baby, or at
                least no way of saving it that I was willing to try. The bugs had tested my resolve and won. </p>
              <p>I put my calathea outside in our courtyard to see if there was any potential for the bugs to somehow disappear
                on their own. There it sits still, completely collapsed and brown. A constant reminder of my failure. </p>
