          <h4>Cinnamon buns</h4>
          <h3>20/07/2020</h3>
        </header>

        <p> My most recent baking disaster was sourdough cinnamon buns. Like everybody else in lockdown I was enticed by the promise
          of a sourdough starter. No more spending £4-5 on a loaf of sourdough and supporting my local bakery, I’d be baking my own
          from now on. I was sent a small ziplock bag of beige sludge by the former CEO of Monzo, who had kindly offered to post
          sourdough starter to anyone who wanted some. I squeezed it into a tub, added flour and water, and put it in my fridge.
          There it sat, fed diligently every week for twelve week. By this point it was pungently sour. I had a cup of discard
          from my latest feed and decided I’d do something with it. So I googled ‘recipes for sourdough discard’ and came across
          this <a href="https://www.theclevercarrot.com/2017/12/how-to-make-sourdough-cinnamon-rolls-step-by-step-guide/" target="_blank">
          cinnamon roll recipe </a>. It seemed just complicated enough to challenge me but having made cinnamon rolls before it had a
          bit of the familiar for comfort. Plus I love an overnight recipe, waking up in the morning with a purpose and the promise of
          something tasty for breakfast. The reviews were good, someone had already asked about making it without a stand mixer and been
          told it was fine, so I was confident.</p>
        <p>Things started off great. I made the dough easily, it was a little sticky but not unmanageably so. The first rise was fine,
          the dough increased in size more than expected as it was a hot day but this is no bad thing. I turned the dough out onto a
          floured and oiled surface and it stuck immediately. Somehow during the rise it had become stickier. Still, I attempted kneading
          and covered my hands in flour and which then stuck to the dough which stuck to my fingers. I ended up washing about a quarter of
          the dough off my hands and down the sink. We’d be eating fewer cinnamon buns but that’s fine - there’s only three of us in my
          flat so we can’t get through twelve buns anyway. I cleaned up and put the dough away for a second rise. After half an hour I
          poked it to see how airy it had become (not very) and folded it into itself a few times - a well documented sourdough technique.
          I covered it again and put it on the counter to rise overnight, foolishly excited for what I thought was going to be my breakfast the next day.</p>
        <p>I woke up late and got to work on it around 10am. What I’d failed to realise was that if you want to eat sourdough cinnamon
          buns for breakfast you have to get up early, like a baker. I figured midday cinnamon buns wouldn’t be so bad so I forged on.
          The first thing I noticed was that my dough smelled sour. Really really sour. I checked the recipe to see if this was expected
          but it made no mention of your dough smelling so sour your eyes water. I figured a go in the oven might somehow cook the sourness
          out (I’m not a professional baker) so I rolled out the dough and added cinnamon sugar and butter. The dough was still extremely
          sticky so rolling it up into lovely swirls was not an option. I tried my best though and loaded the lopsided buns into a greased
          cake tin. Another two hours of rising and they were finally ready for the oven. They baked in forty five minutes and in the meantime
          I made some cream cheese icing. I don’t like cream cheese. I don’t know why I thought adding icing sugar and butter to it would make
          me like it any more, but I was too far in to start questioning the choice I had made twelve hours earlier. I spread the icing on the
          cooled rolls and thought about the decisions that had led to this moment. It was 1pm and I was hungry and all I had to eat was these buns.</p>
          <p>There were so very many things wrong with these buns. The texture was hard and chewy with globs of soft icing that coats your tongue.
            The taste was a combination of extremely sour, sweet and creamy. The butter had melted and then hardened into a cinnamon-y caramel
            that stuck in your teeth. They didn’t look good and they didn’t taste good. I had spent twelve to thirteen hours making unappetising
            lumps of dough and icing. They sat, as all my failed experiments do, on the counter of our kitchen for two days until I needed to use
            one of the three normal sized plates we own and tipped them into the bin. My first foray into sourdough baking was a complete failure
            but an experience. I know now that baking sourdough cinnamon buns is hard, and much more effort than they’re worth.</p>
          <p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this first blog post - I’ll endeavour to do more. For now though I’m going to satisfy my stupid brain and scroll some Twitter.</p>
